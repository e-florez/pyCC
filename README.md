# Cluster Compare (pyCC)

## Introduction:

Introducing ClusterCompare, a comprehensive and powerful Python script designed to revolutionize the way we analyze and compare atomic and molecular clusters. As the cornerstone of your computational analysis, this main script is created to orchestrate a rigorous and insightful comparison of cluster data, facilitating a deeper understanding of their intrinsic properties and interactions.

## Description:

ClusterCompare operates as a conductor, coordinating various data analysis and machine learning modules to extract, compare, and interpret key features of atomic and molecular clusters. Utilizing input in the form of XYZ coordinates, it initiates the generation of essential data, such as radial and angular distributions, in addition to a host of similarity descriptors.

The strength of ClusterCompare lies in its agility and adaptability, capable of integrating with a suite of powerful libraries like numpy, scipy, pandas, and various machine learning tools. It takes the raw power of these libraries and focuses it on the complex and unique task of comparing atomic and molecular clusters. Whether you're studying the subtle variances between similar clusters or exploring the stark contrast between vastly different ones, ClusterCompare is an invaluable tool for uncovering the secrets hidden within your data.

As an open-source project, ClusterCompare is committed to promoting collaborative development, fostering a community of researchers and developers working in unison to continually refine and expand its capabilities. The future of atomic and molecular cluster analysis is here with ClusterCompare.
